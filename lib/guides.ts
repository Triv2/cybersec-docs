    <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
    
    <h2>Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
    <p>In today's connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyber defense programs. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning.</p>
    
    <h2>Core Areas of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Protecting network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft.</li>
      <li><strong>Application Security:</strong> Keeping software and devices free of threats by designing secure applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Information Security:</strong> Protecting the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.</li>
      <li><strong>Operational Security:</strong> Processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> How an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data.</li>
      <li><strong>End-user Education:</strong> Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Common Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software such as viruses, trojans, and ransomware.</li>
      <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.</li>
      <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Eavesdropping on communication between two parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Denial-of-Service Attacks:</strong> Flooding systems, servers, or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth.</li>
      <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Inserting malicious code into SQL statements via web page input.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero-day Exploits:</strong> Attacking vulnerabilities before developers have had an opportunity to create a patch.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Create unique, complex passwords for different accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication:</strong> Add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update operating systems and applications to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Encryption:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Maintain regular backups of important data.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> Educate users about security risks and safe practices.</li>
    </ul>
